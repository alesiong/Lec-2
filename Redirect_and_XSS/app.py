Task 1:
    a.  Visit http://127.0.0.1/, and then visit http://127.0.0.1/set/<type your name here> to set a cookie.
        When you revisit http://127.0.0.1/, the website still remembers your name.
    b.  Complete hi() so that when user visits http://127.0.0.1/hi, it will be redirect to http://127.0.0.1/hello.
    c.  Implement XSS via URL. (It may fails on Safari and Chrome, I will use Firefox to show)
    d.  Fix this XSS loophole in hello().
    optional:   Design your own set_cookie and corresponding view functions by referring the following programs.
